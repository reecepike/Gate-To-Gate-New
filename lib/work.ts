/**
 * The boss.
 *
 * The training plan works because 45 weeks of sessions are known in advance and
 * the engine only adjusts them. Work is not like that — things arrive
 * unannounced. So this is not a calendar. It is a prioritiser that knows
 * exactly how little time you actually have, and says so.
 *
 * Two decisions shape everything below:
 *
 *   1. Capacity comes from the week timetable, not from optimism. Your own
 *      businesses get one ring-fenced slot (Sunday 18:30, 90 min) and four
 *      evenings that exist but are not free in the sense that spending all of
 *      them is free. Wednesday has nothing. That is the budget.
 *
 *   2. A job you are waiting on someone else for is not work. It goes on a
 *      separate chase list, because a two-minute email that unblocks a fortnight
 *      is the highest-leverage thing on the page — and because leaving it in the
 *      do-list makes you feel busy while nothing moves.
